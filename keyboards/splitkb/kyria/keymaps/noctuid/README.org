See [[https://github.com/noctuid/dotfiles/tree/master/remap][this readme]] for information on my layout.

* Advanced Keycodes
Using:
- Mod-Tap/Tap-Hold - using for nearly all thumb keys; have enough thumb keys that don't need to use on home row keys
- US ANSI shifted keycode - for sym layer

Probably will use at some point:
- Macros - for custom keycodes if need

Not Using:
- Command - just bind Quantum Keycodes directly
- Dynamic Macros - software keyboard macros are better
- Grave Escape - too specific; have dedicated thumbkey for escape
- Leader Key - don't see a reason to use over layers
- Programmable Button - don't have a use case for
- Space Cadet Shift - too specific; use Mod-Tap

* Software Features
Using:
- Caps Word - don't need the =-= to =_= translation but auto-disabling at non-word character is nice
- Layers - obviously
- Tap Dance - not for anything frequently used but to put quantum keycodes on a single key (nice to have to require double tap for bootloader/flash so I don't accidentally do that)
- Tap-Hold - using for nearly all thumb keys

Not using:
- Auto Shift - using shift modifier is faster
- Autocorrect - no, (re)type correctly; use software to correct spelling mistakes
- Combos - currently no use for
- Debounce API - only if default doesn't work (no issues so far)
- Key Lock - no use case for; only really needs caps lock
- Key Overrides - maybe for [/{ (like CharShift) but don't currently need
- One Shot - no use case for
- OS Detection - don't yet need
- Raw HID - no use case for
- Secure - don't need
- Send String - not currently using
- Sequencer - dont need
- Swap Hands - I don't use one-hand typing
- Tri Layer - no use case for
- Unicode - it ends up using system software anyway
- Userspace: Sharing Code Between Keymaps - only have one QMK keyboard currently
- WPM Calculation - not necessary
